        <h>🕶️ fsociety: Terms & Underground Policy Agreement</h>
        <p>Welcome to the edge of the internet, fsociety — a place for ghosts, rebels, and digital phantoms. By entering this domain, you accept the following terms carved in the source.</p>

        <h>🧠 Rule #1: No Scripts. No Lazy Junk.</h>
        <p class="line1">Leave your copy-paste garbage at the door.
        Scripts are banned — bring your own fresh, hand-crafted tools.
        We respect creativity. We worship originality.</p>

        <h>🤝 Rule #2: No Shitty Fights, No Flex.</h>
        <p class="line2">This isn’t a cage match — it's a brotherhood.
        No flaming, ego trips, or pointless beef.
        We're here to build, learn, and break stuff — together.
        You mess with the vibe, you're gone.
        </p>

        <h>🕵️‍♂️ Rule #3: Do the Forbidden. Stay Invisible.</h>
        <p class="line3">Yes — we do the illegal, the taboo, the unsanctioned.
        But rule #1 of being here: STAY ANONYMOUS.
        No real names. No personal drama. No bragging.
        Ghost in, ghost out.</p>

        <h class="ls">🧩 fsociety’s Own Policies (yeah, we wrote these):
        🔒 Anonymity > Everything
        </h>
        <p class="line4">We don’t track you. We don’t want your data.
        You screw that up? That's on you. Use a VPN. Use Tor. Use your brain.</p>

        <h class="ls">🧬 Everyone is allowed</h>
        <p class="line4">We dont care about your age just show the skils u have</p>
        
        <h class="ls">⛓ No Backdoors in Shared Tools</h>
        <p class="line4">Share what you want, but no hidden rats, loggers, or snitches.
        We scan and we expose.</p>

        <h class="ls">🧼 Clean Posting Only</h>
        <p class="line4">This is a command center, not a circus, post illegal things.</p>

        <h class="ls">🕳 Respect the Underground</h>
        <p class="line4">Don’t link public, don’t name names, and NEVER invite outsiders.</p>

        <h class="ls">🧠 Final Line:</h>
        <p class="line4">You’re not here to be famous.
        You’re not here to be liked.
        You’re here to disappear in the code — and leave no trace.</p>

        <h class="ls"></h>
        <p class="line4"></p>

        <p class="Last">If you can’t follow these rules, shut the browser now.
        fsociety isn’t for tourists.</p>
